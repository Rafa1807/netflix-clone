# How i created

- First I created the html and styled it with css.
- I created the candidates carousel using forEatch to map the arrays.
- I used innerHTML to add the components directly to the HTML and fetch the information.
- With the carousel created and with the candidates inserted in it, when clicked it will 
open a modal with the information, for the appearance of this modal I used the addEventListener 
method to change the display from "none" to "block".
- To hide the open modal I did the same process, but using the addEventListener method to change
it as soon as I clicked the close button to change the display from "block" to "none".
